    "What is Central Tendency?\n",
    "Measures of central tendency are summary statistics that represent the center point or typical value of a dataset. Examples of these measures include the mean, median, and mode. These statistics indicate where most values in a distribution fall and are also referred to as the central location of a distribution. You can think of central tendency as the propensity for data points to cluster around a middle value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, the mean, median, and mode are the three most common measures of central tendency. Each one calculates the central point using a different method. Choosing the best measure of central tendency depends on the type of data you have. In this post, I explore the mean, median, and mode as measures of central tendency, show you how to calculate them, and how to determine which one is best for your data.\n",

    "Locating the Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "Most articles about the mean, median, and mode focus on how you calculate these measures of central tendency. I’ll certainly to that, but I’m going to start with a slightly different approach. My philosophy throughout my blog is to help you intuitively grasp statistics by focusing on concepts. Consequently, I’m going to start by illustrating the central point of several datasets graphically—so you understand the goal. Then, we’ll move on to choosing the best measure of central tendency for your data and the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three distributions below represent different data conditions. In each distribution, look for the region where the most common values fall. Even though the shapes and type of data are different, you can find that central tendency. That’s the area in the distribution where the most common values are located. These examples cover the mean, median, and mode.\n",

Coming up, you’ll learn that as the distribution and kind of data changes, so does the best measure of central tendency. Consequently, you need to know the type of data you have, and graph it, before choosing between the mean, median, and mode!\n",

    "Whether you’re using the mean, median, or mode, the central tendency is only one characteristic of a distribution. Another aspect is the variability around that central value. While measures of variability is the topic of a different article (link below), this property describes how far away the data points tend to fall from the center. The graph below shows how distributions with the same central tendency (mean = 100) can actually be quite different. The panel on the left displays a distribution that is tightly clustered around the mean, while the distribution on the right is more spread out. It is crucial to understand that the central tendency summarizes only one aspect of a distribution and that it provides an incomplete picture by itself.\n",

    "However, in a skewed distribution, the mean can miss the mark. In the histogram above, it is starting to fall outside the central area. This problem occurs because outliers have a substantial impact on the mean as a measure of central tendency. Extreme values in an extended tail pull the mean away from the center. As the distribution becomes more skewed, the mean is drawn further away from the center. Consequently, it’s best to use the mean as a measure of the central tendency when you have a symmetric distribution. More about this issue when we look at the mean vs median!\n",

However, we discover data entry errors and need to change four values, which are shaded in the Median Fixed dataset. We’ll make them all significantly higher so that we now have a skewed distribution with large outliers.\n",

    "As you can see, the median doesn’t change at all. It is still 46. When comparing the mean vs median, the mean depends on all values in the dataset while the median does not. Consequently, when some of the values are more extreme, the effect on the median is smaller. Of course, with other types of changes, the median can change.
